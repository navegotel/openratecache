# openratecache
Go implementation of the RateCache core.

This is an implementation based on data formats and concepts as of the commercially licensed RateCache. Openratecache efficiently stores rate and availability information which can be queried through a web service with extremely low response times.

OpenRateCache consists of two services, one for writing data to the cache and another one for querying this data.
